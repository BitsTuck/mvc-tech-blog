## Description

The Challenge for Module #14 asked us create a fullstack blog that included functionality to login or create an account, read existing posts, update and delete posts, and comment on posts.

## Usage

In order to experience the full functionality of the site, you must be logged in to an existing account, or create a new account. Posts can be viewed individually by clicking on them, and comments can be left on individual posts. Posts can be deleted and updated individually.


## Challenges

This was a tough one. I did not fully plan out my build strategy, and that led to a lot of wild goose chases and a much more chaotic process than I would have liked. The site is still not fully functional, but at this point I cannot even see the problems anymore. Hopefully I can come back and clean it up another time.
